<p><h2>TERMS OF SERVICE</h2></p>

<b>Terms and Conditions</b><br />
The present Terms and Conditions regulate relations between ULCarpooling, as service/website operator, and the users who are registered.<br />
1. User Account, Formation of Contract<br />
1.1 Users have the opportunity of registering on the website in order to access the full-scale of offers available. Registration and maintenance of user relations shall be subject to the userâ€™s provision of accurate and full details, particularly his active e-mail address.<br />
1.2 Upon registering, the user is free to select a user name and password. The user undertakes to keep his password secret and not to allow third parties access to the user area of the website via his own access data.<br />
1.3 The contract is formed when the user sends the registration form (contract offer) and after ULCarpooling confirms registration, at which point the user can log in for the first time.<br /><br />

2. Description of Services<br />
ULCarpooling provides a website that can display available offers and requests to visitors. ULCarpooling enables the user to search for offers and requests from other users. Registered users can add new offers and/or requests, cancel offers and/or requests, respond to other users' offers and/or requests, edit profile details and review a previous car sharing journey/trip.<br /><br />

3. Obligations of the User<br />
By registering, the user agrees to provide correct and accurate data and to keep this data continuously updated (mobile, email etc.). The user agrees that he may not use the site for any commercial or advertising purposes. The user agrees to conduct himself in a respectful manner, in particular when reviewing trips and/or other users. The use of racist, sexist or homophobic language is not permitted. The disclosure of personal details of other users is not permitted where such disclosure is in breach of the user's privacy.<br />
3.1 Collective Code of Conduct<br />
The user undertakes to comply with the following code of conduct in his behaviour towards other users. These rulings are deemed agreed upon between the provider and the user of carpools and contracted over the ULCarpooling service.<br />
- Passenger and driver are to be at the agreed location five minutes before the agreed time of departure.<br />
- Passenger and driver undertake to wait for a passenger who has not yet appeared for up to 15 minutes after the agreed time of departure at the arranged location.<br />
- Passenger and driver undertake to contact one another by previously exchanged telephone numbers, if they have not changed, or otherwise as agreed upon (messaging system, e-mail), as soon as a delay becomes apparent, at the latest, however, upon the onset of the delay.<br />
3.2 Establishment of Contact<br />
Contact with other users (both over the internal messaging system and over e-mail or through other forms of communication) is only permitted in order to arrange carpools.<br />
3.3 Review and Sanction System<br />
In order to guarantee that particularly reliable drivers or passengers are perceived as such, ULCarpooling enables the users to reciprocally rate one another, both in a positive as well as negative context. ULCarpooling also retains the right to give a rating (both positive and negative) if a fact becomes known that means ULCarpooling believes it justifies a review. You may contact ULCarpooling and comment on the issue in question. ULCarpooling maintains an appropriate procedure in terms of escalation in order to ensure that both users (the rated party and the rater) are able to state their position and will then decide whether or not the entry in question is to be deleted. In the event the user proves to be particularly negative (as a rule upwards of 10 relevant negative reviews), ULCarpooling retains the right to block the user in question from the platform.<br /><br />

4. Liability<br />
ULCarpooling does not guarantee the proper operation and/or the uninterrupted usability or availability of the carpool service at all times, since problems with the server or fluctuations in the quality of access to the service cannot be technically ruled out.<br />
ULCarpooling shall not be liable in the event of any loss, damage or injury suffered by users of the service except where it is deemed to be liable by law (data protection laws etc.)<br /><br />

5. Termination<br />
ULCarpooling has the right to terminate user relations (by blocking, banning, removing etc.) at any time and for any reason, particularly where it is found that the user has breached the Terms of Service.<br /><br />

6. Data Protection<br />
ULCarpooling handles the personal data of its users in accordance with our privacy policy and data protection laws.<br />
